<a id="siemonster" class="anchor" href="#siemonster" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SIEMONSTER</h3>

<p>It has been developed for all companies as a viable alternative to commercial SIEM solutions. The product is free, fully documented, there is no data or node limitations. Kustodian will continue to develop and support SIEMonster with the community. Kustodian have done this development for you and built a SIEM using open source built on Elastic without the price tag of Shield or Marvel. The free open source version is called SIEMonster.</p>

<p>SIEMonster is a free open source unlimited use version comes with all the dashboards, plugins, incident response tools including ticketing systems to make a functioning SIEM and Security Operation Centre (SOC). SIEMonster is a commercial grade enterprise SIEM with dashboard development and a suite of documentation (Standard Operating Procedures, Detailed Designs, DR fail over, Backups, installation guides etc.)</p>

<p>After the successful development and roll out of an Open source SOC into a multi-region stock listed company with over 20,000 seats it made sense to allow companies to use our system for their own environments. The solution can be either onsite in a data centre or in the cloud such as AWS. This solution makes it simple for businesses to use open source SIEM technologies without the development headaches, documentation integration, and unlimited use and is affordable which all other products don’t provide.</p>
